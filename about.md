I am a fifth year PhD candidate at the University of Texas at Dallas. My research interests are the informal economy, specifically its measurements and how it is shaped by both domestic and foreign variables. I have been in a teaching role for 12 years, and enjoy the daily interactions with students as I help them learn more about the complecsted relationships prevalent in international political economy. I plan to complete my dissertaion by December 2020 and hope to find a teaching-focused academic position.

### More Information

I am fortunate to have a wonderful wife of 14 years and two amazing kiddos who teach me something every day!
